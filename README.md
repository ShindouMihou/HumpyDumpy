## üßã What is Humpy Dumpy?

Humpy Dumpy is a simple Discord bot that aims to provide a snapshot of the join logs given a range of time for servers. It was created as a little boredom-reliever 
based on an idea that came from suggestions of [Beemo](https://beemo.gg)'s Discord server which people wanted a simple and easy way to dump join logs.

## üí≠ How does Humpy Dumpy work?

Humpy Dumpy works with the combination of MongoDB and Javacord to receive and store a snapshot of the user's information and related information onto a time-series 
collection to allow massive datasets with very little storage usage and performance impact *(200k users was around 900 kilobytes of storage space according to MongoDB Compass)*.

Humpy Dumpy uses Javalin as its web framework to enable server moderators to receive a snapshot of the server's join logs at a given time range. To learn more about how to 
query with the HTTP API, please read the section below.

## ‚ùì Humpy Dumpy Flow

Humpy Dumpy provides a privacy-safe and simple HTTP API for server moderators to request their server join logs within a given timestamp but before we delve into how each query 
works, let us first understand the different routes available.
- `/range.json`: This route enables for a full JSON representation of the server logs, this contains all the information needed like user name, discriminator, join timestamp, etc.
- `/range.txt`: This route is a more simpler version of the JSON route and returns a plain-text content that contains **only the users snowflakes** (intended for mass banning).

Now that we have understood what the different routes means, let us delve into the query parameters available for each one.

### üìò JSON Route

| Parameter | Type                                                | Optional | Example                                                                                                    | Additional Notes                                                                             |

### üìñ Plain-text Route

|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| before    | modified rfc 1132 datetime or minutes ago since now |     ‚úîÔ∏è    | 17 Aug 2022, 16:34:12 UTC or 30                                                                            | If using minutes ago since now, it takes the current time and minus it by the given minutes. |

### üí≠ Modified RFC 1132 Date Time

To make it more human-friendly to read, all routes uses a Modified RFC 1132 (17 Aug 2022, 16:34:12 UTC) variant for its parameters. It's the same as the 
RFC 1132 Date Time (Wed, 17 Aug 2022, 16:34:12 UTC) but without the week of the day (Wed) which can be a mess to modify and cause issues for the end-user.

### üí≠ Minutes Ago Since Now

Minutes ago since now should be self-explanatory, it is the minutes ago since now. To understand this, let us say that our current time is 06:30 and we set a 
minutes ago since now to 30 minutes, our new time would be 06:00 because the minutes ago since now would reduce the current time by the given value (30 minutes).

### üí≠ JSON Web Token

JSON Web Token is an authentication or security identifier that **should not be disclosed easily to others**. All tokens generated by Humpy Dumpy have a maximum time limit of 
one (1) hour to prevent a misuse of the authentication token. Please keep this token as safe as possible unless you want your join logs to be viewed by other people.

### üí≠ Acquiring a JSON Web Token

Acquiring a JSON Web Token is as simple as running the `/token` slash command on the server that you want to use the token on. A token is limited to only one server and you cannot use it to 
view other servers that you own or manage. A token have a maximum of one hour expiration and configureable down to five minutes to ensure that it is used to expose view logs (invading privacy) 
of servers.

### üí≠ Example Requests

> **Warning**
>
> Humpy Dumpy is not available publicly at the moment, but you can self-host it with the Dockerfile provided.
> Please read the self-hosting section for more information.

To understand how our requests look, let us say that we want to query our server's recent 30 minutes joins, we can simply open a new browser tab and run the following:
```
http://humpydumpy.mihou.pw/range.json?server=<server_id>&after=30&token=<token>
```

The following query requests for all recent joins after (current_time - 30 minutes).
